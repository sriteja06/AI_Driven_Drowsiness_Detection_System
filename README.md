Driver Drowsiness Detection System

This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision techniques. It analyzes various facial features such as eye closure, blink rate, and head movement from webcam or in-car camera feeds to detect signs of driver fatigue. The system includes integrated alert mechanisms (audio and vibration) that warn drivers when fatigue is detected, aiming to improve road safety.

Features:

Real-time detection of drowsy driving using computer vision.

Facial feature analysis including eye closure and blink rate.

Integration with webcam/in-car camera feeds.

Alert system with audio and vibration feedback to warn drivers.
